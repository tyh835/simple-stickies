# Simple Stickys

React/Django app backed by Postgres and Docker.

Ensure you have `pipenv`, `yarn`, and `docker-compose` installed.

Run `yarn test` to run unit tests.

Run `yarn start` to begin development.

Run `yarn build` to build for production (Webpack and Docker Images)

Run `yarn stop` to stop running containers in dev following quitting webpack.

Work in Progress.
